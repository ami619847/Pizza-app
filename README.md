# Pizza Configurator App

This is a week 5 homework assignment using React, Redux and some Material UI. 

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository
1. Yarn install 
1. Yarn start to run the app 

## Requirements
You’re asked to create a pizza configurator for NewAgePizza.com, a new and hip venture to get your pizza. It should be a single page that contains all the following elements.
1. Pick your base. You have four options:
   1. 25cm NY Style € 8,99
   1. 30cm NY Style € 11,49
   1. 35cm NY Style € 13,49
   1. 20cm NY Style € 6,45

1. Pick your sauce options:
   1. White sauce
   1. Red sauce
   1. Double red sauce € 1,00
   1. Mix it up € 1,50

1. Pick one or more toppings:
   1. Pineapple
   1. Corn
   1. Olives (green)
   1. Red union
   1. Spinach
   1. Cherry tomatoes
   1. Chicken

Rules: max. 3 toppings, toppings cost € 0,50 apiece

1. Last but not least, you can choose turbo-drone-delivery which is an additional 10% on top of the total pizza price.

Make sure you can change previous steps even if you already changed stuff before. So I could pick a base, a sauce and a topping and switch the base after that.

Additional instructions:
   1. If any base is picked there should always be a price shown for the total pizza.
   1. The Redux store should contain the state of the pizza
   1. You don’t need any back end connection
   1. Make sure you split your app into separate components
   1. We expect you to use controlled form components as they are the best practice
